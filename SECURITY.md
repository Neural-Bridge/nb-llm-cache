## Reporting a Vulnerability
Should you discover a security flaw within our projects, please reach out to us at email@email.email, using "Security Vulnerability Report" as the subject of your email. We commit to providing a response within a 72-hour window to inform you if your report has been acknowledged or not. We kindly ask that you refrain from creating a public issue on the matter; instead, we will handle the issue creation internally if we validate your concern. To prevent the risk of exposing the vulnerability, the issue will be kept confidential. Rest assured, we will update you once the identified vulnerability has been addressed or sufficiently mitigated.
